numpy is a general purpose array-processing package. 
It provides a high-performance multidimensional array object, 
and tools for working with these arrays. 
It is the fundamental package for scientific computing with Python.
 It contains among other things:

a powerful N-dimensional array object
sophisticated (broadcasting) functions
tools for integrating C/C++ and Fortran code
useful linear algebra, Fourier transform, and random number capabilities
